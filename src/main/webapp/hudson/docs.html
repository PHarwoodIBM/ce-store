<div id="header-1">1. Hudson</div>
<div id="plain-text">
"Hudson" is the named given to the simple question answering APIs that are implemented
on top of the ce-store environment.  Using ce-store and the Controlled English language
you can quickly and easily define conceptual models and associated instance information
using a structured form of English.  This data is instantiated as a labelled directed
graph in memory within the ce-store and a rich set of REST APIs enable the navigation of
this graph, the definition and execution of logical inference rules and queries, the
implementation of machine agents and more.
</div>

<div id="plain-text">
Hudson provides a Natural Language (i.e. plain text) interface to any data defined in
Controlled English and loaded into a ce-store.  This can provide a very rapid development
environment for conversational interactions with structured data.  Through the provision
of a small set of APIs (see below) Hudson can provide a generic question interpretation
capability and a default question answering capability to return answers to data held
within the ce-store environment.  However, in many cases the data itself will not be held
inside the ce-store and will instead be held in existing data sources (SQL, CSV, XML, JSON etc)
or behind existing APIs.  In these scenarios the interpreter API can be used to quickly
interpret natural language text in the context of a ce-store conceptual model with the
result of the interpretation being returned in JSON for passing on to any number of
separate answerer APIs.
</div>

<div id="plain-text">
There are 4 main APIs provided by Hudson:

<ul>
 <li><a href="#api-interpret">interpret</a></li>
 <li><a href="#api-answer">answer</a></li>
 <li><a href="#api-execute">execute</a></li>
 <li><a href="#api-help">help</a></li>
</ul>

In addition to these there are 2 additional management APIs:

<ul>
 <li><a href="#api-reset">reset</a></li>
 <li><a href="#api-status">status</a></li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="header-1">2. APIs</div>
<div id="plain-text">
The Hudson service presents two main APIs and one management API as described below.
</div>
<div id="plain-text"><br/><br/></div>

<div id="header-2">2.1 General information</div>

<a id="common-http-request-headers"></a>
<div id="header-3">2.1.1 HTTP request headers</div>
<div id="plain-text">
The following HTTP headers should be specified in all requests:
<ul>
 <li><span id="http-header">Accept</span>: <span id="http-value">application/json</span></li>
 <li><span id="http-header">Content-type</span>: <span id="http-value">text/plain; charset=UTF-8</span></li>
</ul>
If the above headers are not set then default values corresponding to the expected values (i.e. those specified above) will be used by the server.
</div>

<div id="plain-text"><br/><br/></div>

<div id="header-2"><a id="api-interpret"></a>2.2 Interpret API</div>
<div id="plain-text">
This is called when the user submits a question to be interpreted.
<br/>
To call this API:

<div id="plain-text"><br/><br/></div>

<span id="http-type">HTTP POST</span> to the target url, e.g. <span id="url">http://localhost:8080/ce-store/special/hudson/interpreter</span>
<br/>
...with plain text <span id="http-header">post payload</span> containing the question being asked: e.g. <span id="http-value">who is Jean?</span>
<br/>
...and http request as <a href="#common-http-request-headers">specified earlier</a>
</div>

<div id="plain-text"><br/><br/></div>

<a id="interpret-json"></a>

<div id="header-3">2.3.1 Notes for answer API</div>
<div id="plain-text">
<ul>
 <li>The <span id="json-key">question_text</span> is repeated for each <span id="json-key">suggestion</span> object because different capitalisations of the typed question may be required (e.g. see first example)</li>
 <li>The <span id="json-key">interpretation_text</span> element contains the question that was interpreted and used by Hudson.  This may be different from the actual text specified by the user, but is returned to convey the question that is actaully being answered.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="header-3">2.3.2. Confidence calculation</div>
<div id="plain-text">
There are three confidence values returned by the question executor API.  Each will be an integer in the range 0 - 100.  These confidences are:
<ul>
 <li>
  <span id="json-key">interpretation_confidence</span> (applies to the <span id="json-key">question</span>)
  <br/>
  This is the "main" confidence value and is computed according to how many of the words in the question from the user were matched to the knowledge base either as concepts (e.g. "match", "win" etc), instances (e.g. glossary terms like "love" or "underspin", events like "Ladies' Doubles", rounds like "Quarter-Finals", or properties that link concepts together).
  <br/>
  The algorithm (introduced in v1.0.11) is very basic: It splits the incoming words into three categories:
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span id="emphasize">"matched"</span>: words which do match to the knowledge base as described above.
    <span id="emphasize">"common"</span>: common words such as "and", "or", "it", and questioon words such as "who", "when" etc.
    <span id="emphasize">"missed"</span>: words which are neither <span id="emphasize">matched</span> or <span id="emphasize">common</span>.  These are words outside of Hudson's realm of knowledge.
   </li>
   Using the above classifications the <span id="emphasize">common</span> words are ignored and the confidence is computed as: <span id="emphasize">matched</span> / (<span id="emphasize">matched</span> + (<span id="emphasize">missed</span> * 3)).
   <br/>
   This is a crude mechanism for ensuring 100% confidence when all non-common words are matched, and a steep reduction in confidence as the percentage of matched words declines.
   <br/>
   This algorithm is likely to be refined in future releases, and will ideally be made available via CE configuration to allow easy modification.
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <span id="json-key">ability_to_confidence</span> (applies to the <span id="json-key">question</span>)
  <br/>
  This value is not currently populated but an algorithm will be introduced shortly.  The purpose of this value is to convey how likely the question is able to be answered.
  <br/>
  The algorithm will involve investigating the sources for each of the matched words to determine if data is available.
  <br/>
  This confidence is important because the Hudson knowledge base will define a model which may be broader than the available data sources, allowing questions to be understood but not answered.  It is essential for user confidence reasons that Hudson is able to convey that the question was understood but could not be answered due to lack of data, rather than simply appearing to have not understood the question.
  <br/>
  Conveying the lack of data back to the users may inspire additional efforts by the community to crowd source the missing data, or map additional data sources that contain it.
 </li>
 <li>
  <span id="json-key">confidence</span> (applies to each <span id="json-key">answer</span>)
  <br/>
  This is computed for each answer that it returned.  It may be different for different answers.
  <br/>
  The baseline value is the <span id="emphasize">interpretation_confidence</span> from the question (described earlier).  This is the maximum value that can be returned for an answer.
  <br/>
  Each answer may be modified by the credibility of the source (e.g. a source with 80% credibility will result in 80% of the <span id="emphasize">interpretation_confidence</span> being returned for that question).
  <br/>
  In the event of a technical error such as a SQL failure the <span id="emphasize">confidence</span> is set to 0.
  <br/>  
  Additionally, certain <span id="json-key">result_code</span> responses return predefined <span id="emphasize">confidence</span> values.
 </li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="header-3">2.3.3 result_code values</div>
<div id="plain-text">
The following <span id="json-key">result_code</span> values are possible to return:
<ul>
 <li><span id="json-value">GENERAL</span>: A general unhandled error.</li>
 <li><span id="json-value">NOT_UNDERSTOOD</span>: The question was not understood at all (will have a corresponding <span id="json-key">interpretation_confidence</span> of <span id="json-value">0</span>).</li>
 <li><span id="json-value">CANNOT_LOCATE</span>: When the question identified a need for a location to be returned but nothing locatable was specified.</li>
 <li><span id="json-value">NO_COORDS</span>: When the question identified a need for a location to be returned but none was found.</li>
 <li><span id="json-value">NO_MEDIA</span>: When the question identified a need for media (e.g. imagery) to be returned but none was found.</li>
 <li><span id="json-value">GREETING</span>: The question involved a greeting word like 'Hello'.</li>
 <li><span id="json-value">NEGATION</span>: The question contained a negation word like "didn't"</li>
 <li><span id="json-value">PREDICTION</span>: The question contained a prediction word like 'future'</li>

<div id="header-2"><a id="api-execute"></a>2.4 Execute API</div>
<div id="plain-text">
The execute API is simply a concatenation of the <a href="#api-interpret">interpret API</a> and the <a href="#api-answer">answer API</a> and therefore takes the input information required by the interpret API and provides the response specified for the answer API.  The intermediate call between the interpret and the answer is not exposed.  This can be useful for quickly creating a question answering system without too much configuration, however it does not provide the flexibility for having a single interpretation service and multiple answerer services.

Note: The algorithm behind this API is currently very simplistic so fairly simple lists of help suggestions are returned.
In a future update additional context sensitivity will be added to improve the suggestions that are returned.
