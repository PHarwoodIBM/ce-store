<div id="header-1">1. Hudson</div>
<div id="plain-text">
Here is some body text.
<br/><br/>
</div>

<div id="header-1">2. APIs</div>
<div id="plain-text">
The Hudson service presents two main APIs and one management API as described below.
<br/><br/>
</div>

<div id="header-2">2.1 Common features</div>
There are a number of common features and considerations for the the Hudson APIs.<br/>

<a id="common-http-request-headers"></a>
<div id="header-3">2.1.1 HTTP request headers</div>
The following HTTP headers should be specified in all requests:
<ul>
 <li><span id="http-header">Accept</span>: <span id="http-value">application/json</span></li>
 <li><span id="http-header">Content-type</span>: <span id="http-value">text/plain; charset=UTF-8</span></li>
</ul>
If the above headers are not set then default values corresponding to the expected values (above) will be used by the server.<br/>
There is also one optional parameter that can be used to specify a unique identity (e.g. name or generated session id) for the Hudson user:<br/>
<ul>
 <li><span id="http-header">CE_User</span>: <span id="http-value">(a unique identifier for the user/session)</span></li>
</ul>

<a id="common-url parameters"></a>
<div id="header-3">2.1.2 URL parameters</div>
The following additional parameters can be provided to any Hudson request by appending to the url, e.g. <span id="url">?debug=true</span>
<ul>
 <li>
  <span id="parameter-name">debug</span>: <span id="parameter-value">true</span> or <span id="parameter-value">false</span><br/>
  If this parameter is not specified the default value is <span id="parameter-value">false</span><br/>
  If specified as <span id="parameter-value">true</span> then additional JSON elements are returned in the response.  See each API below for details of these additional elements since they vary by API.
 </li>
</ul>

<div id="header-2">2.2 Helper API</div>
<div id="plain-text">
This can be called as the user is typing a question in order to provide type-ahead style suggestions for completion of the sentence.  The two examples below show cases with suggestions both before and after the currently typed text.<br/>
To call this API:<br/><br/>

<span id="http-type">HTTP POST</span> to the target url, e.g. <span id="url">http://answers.mytoycode.com:9080/Hudson/QuestionHelper</span><br/>
...with plain text <span id="http-header">post payload</span> containing the question text typed so far: e.g. <span id="http-value">what is a</span><br/>
...and http request as <a href="#common-http-request-headers">specified earlier</a><br/>
</div>
<br/>
The following example JSON is returned from typical Helper API requests:<br/><br/>

Simple case with only <span id="http-parameter">after_text</span> returned:<br/>

<div id ="code-snippet">
<pre>
  <span id="json-object">{</span> <span id="json-key">"suggestions"</span>: <span id="json-array">[</span>
      <span id="json-object">{</span> <span id="json-key">"question_text"</span>: <span id="json-value">"what is a"</span>, <span id="json-key">"after_text"</span>: <span id="json-value">"ce?"</span><span id="json-object">}</span><span id="json-comma">, </span>

    <span id="json-array">]</span>
  <span id="json-object">}</span>
</pre>
</div>

Advanced case with <span id="http-parameter">before_text</span> and <span id="http-parameter">after_text</span> returned:<br/>

<div id ="code-snippet">
<pre>
  <span id="json-object">{</span> <span id="json-key">"suggestions"</span>: <span id="json-array">[</span>

    <span id="json-array">]</span>
  <span id="json-object">}</span>
</pre>
</div>

If the <span id="parameter-name">debug</span> url parameter is set to <span id="parameter-value">true</span> the the following additional JSON element is returned in the root element:<br/>

<div id ="code-snippet">
<pre>
  <span id="json-key">"debug"</span>: <span id="json-object">{</span>
    <span id="json-key">"execution_time_ms"</span>: <span id="json-value">123</span>,

      <span id="json-array">]</span>
    <span id="json-object">}</span>
  <span id="json-object">}</span>
</pre>
</div>

<div id="header-3">2.2.1 Notes for helper API</div>
<div id="plain-text">
<ul>
 <li>The <span id="json-key">question_text</span> is repeated for each <span id="json-key">suggestion</span> object because different capitalisations of the typed question may be required (e.g. see first example)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="header-2">2.3 Question Executor API</div>
<div id="plain-text">
This is called when the user submits a question to be executed.<br/>
To call this API:<br/><br/>

<span id="http-type">HTTP POST</span> to the target url, e.g. <span id="url">http://answers.mytoycode.com:9080/Hudson/QuestionExecutor</span><br/>
...with plain text <span id="http-header">post payload</span> containing the question being asked: e.g. <span id="http-value">what is underspin?</span><br/>
...and http request as <a href="#common-http-request-headers">specified earlier</a><br/>
</div>
<br/>
The following example JSON is returned from Question Executor API requests:

<div id ="code-snippet">
<pre>
  <span id="json-object">{</span>
    <span id="json-key">"question"</span>: <span id="json-object">{</span>

      <span id="json-object">}</span>
    <span id="json-array">]</span>
  <span id="json-object">}</span>
</pre>
</div>

In the example above a simple <span id="json-key">result_text</span> response is shown, however this element can be replaced by any one of the more complex alternatives depending on the type of answer that is returned:
<ul>
 <li>
  A simple single answer (<span id="json-key">result_text</span>)<br/>
  e.g. returned when asking: <span id="http-value">what is underspin?</span>
  <pre>
    <span id="json-key">"result_text"</span>: <span id="json-value">"Spin of a ball where the top of the ball rotates away..."</span>,
  </pre>
 </li>
 <li>
  A table of values (<span id="json-key">result_set</span>)<br/>
  e.g. returned when asking: <span id="http-value">how many aces from deuce by year?</span><br/>
  Note that when locations are returned they use this structure with <span id="json-value">lat</span> and <span id="json-value">lon</span> headers.
  <pre>
    <span id="json-key">"result_set"</span>: <span id="json-object">{</span>
      <span id="json-key">"headers"</span>: <span id="json-array">[</span> <span id="json-value">"year_id"</span>, <span id="json-value">"sum"</span> <span id="json-array">]</span>,
      <span id="json-key">"rows"</span>: <span id="json-array">[</span>
        <span id="json-array">[</span> <span id="json-value">"1992"</span>, <span id="json-value">"890"</span> <span id="json-array">]</span>,
        <span id="json-array">[</span> <span id="json-value">"1993"</span>, <span id="json-value">"902"</span> <span id="json-array">]</span>
      <span id="json-array">]</span>
    <span id="json-object">}</span>
  </pre>
 </li>
 <li>
  A code as an answer, to signify a specific situation like an error or an unhandled question (<span id="json-key">result_code</span>)<br/>
  e.g. returned when asking: <span id="http-value">what does Andy Murray look like?</span><br/>
  Use of these codes enables the UI to substitute an appropriate response to the user but there will also be a <span id="json_key">chatty_text</span> element in the reponse too which contains more description.<br/>

  <pre>
    <span id="json-key">"result_code"</span>: <span id="json-value">"NO_MEDIA"</span>
  </pre>
 </li>
 <li>
  A link to external media (e.g. imagery) as an answer, to enable pictures and videos to be shown (<span id="json-key">result_media</span>)<br/>
  e.g. returned when asking: <span id="http-value">what does Roger Federer look like?</span>
  <pre>
    <span id="json-key">"result_media"</span>: <span id="json-object">{</span>
      <span id="json-key">"id"</span>: <span id="json-value">Roger Federer</span>,
      <span id="json-key">"url"</span>: <span id="json-value">atpf324.jpg</span>,
      <span id="json-key">"credit"</span>: <span id="json-value">Photo Courtesy ATP Tour</span>
    <span id="json-object">{</span>
  </pre>
 </li>
 <li>
  A link to geospatial coordinates (e.g. lat/lon) as an answer, to enable rendering on a map (<span id="json-key">result_coords</span>)<br/>
  e.g. returned when asking: <span id="http-value">where is centre court?</span>
  <pre>
    <span id="json-key">"result_coords"</span>: <span id="json-object">{</span>
      <span id="json-key">"id"</span>: <span id="json-value">Centre Court</span>,
      <span id="json-key">"lat"</span>: <span id="json-value">51.43371612</span>,
      <span id="json-key">"lon"</span>: <span id="json-value">-0.21405937</span>
    <span id="json-object">{</span>
  </pre>
 </li>
</ul>
If the <span id="parameter-name">debug</span> url parameter is set to <span id="parameter-value">true</span> the the following additional JSON element is returned in the root element:<br/>

<div id ="code-snippet">
<pre>
  <span id="json-key">"debug"</span>: <span id="json-object">{</span>
    <span id="json-key">"execution_time_ms"</span>: <span id="json-value">123</span>,

      <span id="json-key">"errors"</span>: <span id="json-array">[</span>
        <span id="json-value">"an error message may appear here"</span>
      <span id="json-array">]</span>,
      <span id="json-key">"debugs"</span>: <span id="json-array">[</span>

      <span id="json-array">]</span>
    <span id="json-object">}</span>
  <span id="json-object">}</span>
</pre>
</div>

<div id="header-3">2.3.1 Notes for question executor API</div>
<div id="plain-text">
<ul>
 <li>The <span id="json-key">question_text</span> is repeated for each <span id="json-key">suggestion</span> object because different capitalisations of the typed question may be required (e.g. see first example)</li>
 <li>The <span id="json-key">interpretation_text</span> element contains the question that was interpreted and used by Hudson.  This may be different from the actual text specified by the user, but is returned to convey the question that is actaully being answered.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="header-3">2.3.2. Confidence calculation</div>
<div id="plain-text">
There are three confidence values returned by the question executor API.  Each will be an integer in the range 0 - 100.  These confidences are:
<ul>
 <li>
  <span id="json-key">interpretation_confidence</span> (applies to the <span id="json-key">question</span>)<br/>
  This is the "main" confidence value and is computed according to how many of the words in the question from the user were matched to the knowledge base either as concepts (e.g. "match", "win" etc), instances (e.g. glossary terms like "love" or "underspin", events like "Ladies' Doubles", rounds like "Quarter-Finals", or properties that link concepts together).<br/>
  The algorithm (introduced in v1.0.11) is very basic: It splits the incoming words into three categories:
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span id="emphasize">"matched"</span>: words which do match to the knowledge base as described above.
    <span id="emphasize">"common"</span>: common words such as "and", "or", "it", and questioon words such as "who", "when" etc.
    <span id="emphasize">"missed"</span>: words which are neither <span id="emphasize">matched</span> or <span id="emphasize">common</span>.  These are words outside of Hudson's realm of knowledge.
   </li>
   Using the above classifications the <span id="emphasize">common</span> words are ignored and the confidence is computed as: <span id="emphasize">matched</span> / (<span id="emphasize">matched</span> + (<span id="emphasize">missed</span> * 3)).<br/>
   This is a crude mechanism for ensuring 100% confidence when all non-common words are matched, and a steep reduction in confidence as the percentage of matched words declines.<br/>
   This algorithm is likely to be refined in future releases, and will ideally be made available via CE configuration to allow easy modification.
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <span id="json-key">ability_to_answer_confidence</span> (applies to the <span id="json-key">question</span>)<br/>
  This value is not currently populated but an algorithm will be introduced shortly.  The purpose of this value is to convey how likely the question is able to be answered.<br/>
  The algorithm will involve investigating the sources for each of the matched words to determine if data is available.<br/>
  This confidence is important because the Hudson knowledge base will define a model which may be broader than the available data sources, allowing questions to be understood but not answered.  It is essential for user confidence reasons that Hudson is able to convey that the question was understood but could not be answered due to lack of data, rather than simply appearing to have not understood the question.<br/>
  Conveying the lack of data back to the users may inspire additional efforts by the community to crowd source the missing data, or map additional data sources that contain it.
 </li>
 <li>
  <span id="json-key">answer_confidence</span> (applies to each <span id="json-key">answer</span>)<br/>
  This is computed for each answer that it returned.  It may be different for different answers.<br/>
  The baseline value is the <span id="emphasize">interpretation_confidence</span> from the question (described earlier).  This is the maximum value that can be returned for an answer.<br/>
  Each answer may be modified by the credibility of the source (e.g. a source with 80% credibility will result in 80% of the <span id="emphasize">interpretation_confidence</span> being returned for that question).<br/>
  In the event of a technical error such as a SQL failure the <span id="emphasize">answer_confidence</span> is set to 0.<br/>  
  Additionally, certain <span id="json-key">result_code</span> responses return predefined <span id="emphasize">answer_confidence</span> values.
 </li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>
</div>

<div id="header-3">2.3.3 result_code values</div>
<div id="plain-text">
The following <span id="json-key">result_code</span> values are possible to return:
<ul>
 <li><span id="json-value">GENERAL</span>: A general unhandled error.</li>
 <li><span id="json-value">ERROR_SQL</span>: An error executing the generated SQL query.</li>
 <li><span id="json-value">NEGATION</span>: The user specified some kind of negation (like "no" or "not") that is not currently handled.</li>
 <li><span id="json-value">NOT_UNDERSTOOD</span>: The question was not understood at all (will have a corresponding <span id="json-key">interpretation_confidence</span> of <span id="json-value">0</span>).</li>
 <li><span id="json-value">CANNOT_LOCATE</span>: When the question identified a need for a location to be returned but nothing locatable was specified.</li>
 <li><span id="json-value">NO_COORDS</span>: When the question identified a need for a location to be returned but none was found.</li>
 <li><span id="json-value">NO_MEDIA</span>: When the question identified a need for media (e.g. imagery) to be returned but none was found.</li>
 <li><span id="json-value">GREETING</span>: The question involved a greeting word like 'Hello'.</li>
 <li><span id="json-value">NEGATION</span>: The question contained a negation word like "didn't"</li>
 <li><span id="json-value">PREDICTION</span>: The question contained a prediction word like 'future'</li>

<div id="header-1">4. Installation guide</div>

<div id="header-2">4.1 Pre-requisites</div>
<div id="plain-text">
In order to install and configure the Hudson component you need the following:
<ol>
 <li>An environment in which:
  <ul>
   <li><a href="https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/websphere-liberty/">WebSphere Liberty</a> is installed</li>
   <li>The db2 java client libraries (db2jcc4.jar) available in a known location 
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>A copy of the Hudson.war file</li>
 <li>
  The connection details for the remote db2 database hosting the live data<br/>
  (JDBC URL, server name, port, database name, userid, password)
 </li>
</ol>
</div>

<div id="header-2">4.2 Initial configuration</div>
<div id="plain-text">
To initially configure this environment simply edit the <i>server.xml</i> file for the WebSphere Liberty environment.<br/>
<br/>
First add the <i>JDBC</i> feature by specifying the appropriate line in the features list:
</div>
<pre id="code-snippet">
    &lt;featureManager&gt;
        ...
        &lt;feature&gt;jdbc-4.0&lt;/feature&gt;
    &lt;/featureManager&gt;
</pre>
<div id="plain-text">
Then add the following to define the required datasource:
</div>
<pre id="code-snippet">
    &lt;library id="DB2JCC4Lib"&gt;
        &lt;fileset dir="<i>{DB2_JAVA_PATH}</i>" includes="db2jcc4.jar db2jcc_license_cisuz.jar"/&gt;
    &lt;/library&gt;

    &lt;dataSource id="db2" jndiName="jdbc/db2" connectionSharing="MatchCurrentState"
            isolationLevel="TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED" statementCacheSize="20"&gt;
        &lt;connectionManager maxPoolSize="20" minPoolSize="5" connectionTimeout="10s" agedTimeout="30m"/&gt;
        &lt;jdbcDriver libraryRef="DB2JCC4Lib"/&gt;
        &lt;properties.db2.jcc databaseName="<i>{DB_NAME}</i>" serverName="<i>{DB_SERVERNAME}</i>"
            portNumber="<i>{DB_PORT}</i>" currentLockTimeout="30s" user="<i>{DB_USER}</i>" password="<i>{DB_PASS}</i>"/&gt;
    &lt;/dataSource&gt;
</pre>
<div id="plain-text">
Where:
<ul>
 <li><i>{DB2_JAVA_PATH}</i> is the location where the db2jcc4.jar file can be found, e.g. <i>/opt/ibm/db2/V10.5/java</i></li>
 <li><i>{DB_NAME}</i> is the name of the database, e.g. <i>WAREHSE</i></li>
 <li><i>{DB_SERVERNAME}</i> is the hostname or url where the database is located, e.g. <i>localhost</i></li>
 <li><i>{DB_PORT}</i> is the port which must be used to access the database server, e.g. <i>60000</i></li>
 <li><i>{DB_USER}</i> is the database username, e.g. <i>db2inst1</i></li>
 <li><i>{DB_PASS}</i> is the password for the above database username</li>
</ul>
Note: If you also wish to enable (optional) file logging of all questions received by the server make the following additional changes to <i>server.xml</i>:
</div>
<pre id="code-snippet">
    &lt;featureManager&gt;
        ...
        &lt;feature&gt;jndi-1.0&lt;/feature&gt;
    &lt;/featureManager&gt;

    &lt;jndiEntry jndiName="Hudson/question_directoryname" value='<i>{LOG_DIR}</i>'/&gt;
</pre>
<div id="plain-text">
Where:
<ul>
 <li>
  <i>{LOG_DIR}</i> is the directory where the questions will be logged, e.g. <i>/home/davebraines/logged_questions/</i><br/>
  Ensure that this directory exists and can be written by the user running the WebSphere Liberty process.
 </li>
</ul>
If you enable file logging, all received questions will be logged as single lines in a plain text file named <i>logged_questions.txt</i> in the specified directory.
Save the <i>server.xml</i> file.  You should not need to restart WebSphere Liberty.
<br/><br/>
</div>

<div id="header-2">4.3 Deploying the Hudson application</div>
<div id="plain-text">
Simply copy the <i>Hudson.war</i> file into the Liberty "dropins" folder, e.g. <i>/opt/ibm/liberty/wlp/usr/servers/defaultServer/dropins</i>.<br/>
Liberty will automatically deploy the file and you can then test the application via the tester UI, e.g. http://localhost:9080/Hudson/<br/>
Note: the version of the Hudson application is displayed at the top of the test page
